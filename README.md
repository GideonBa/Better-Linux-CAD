# BLCAD

BLCAD will be an independent, headless-first parametric CAD system for Linux with an optional
desktop UI, in active development.

All architecture, feature contracts, persistence semantics, roadmaps, and current implementation status live in [`docs/`](docs/). This README is intentionally kept small and evergreen — it is not a status page.

The assembly sequence is implemented through Block 47, Part Construction MVP-6 is complete through Block 94, and GUI Feature Validation MVP-7 is accepted through Block 105. The optional Qt desktop covers document, Sketch, Part, Surface, Assembly, motion, analysis, and STEP-export workflows without moving authority out of Core/Geometry. Blocks 106–121 plan a substantially more usable, direct-manipulation Interactive Sketcher in [`docs/interactive-sketcher-sequence-mvp8.md`](docs/interactive-sketcher-sequence-mvp8.md); STEP Import MVP-9 follows in Blocks 122–128.
