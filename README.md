# BLCAD

BLCAD will be an independent, headless parametric CAD system for Linux, in active development.

All architecture, feature contracts, persistence semantics, roadmaps, and current implementation status live in [`docs/`](docs/). This README is intentionally kept small and evergreen — it is not a status page.

The assembly sequence is implemented through Block 47. Part Construction Blocks 48–55 add Body identity, body-scoped recompute/inspection, persistent BodyBooleanFeature intent, and transactional OCCT Boolean execution; the current contract is [`docs/part-body-boolean-geometry-mvp6.md`](docs/part-body-boolean-geometry-mvp6.md). Block 56 — BodyTransform and SketchOwnership Core intent plus JSON — is the next technical step.

## Repository layout

- [`include/blcad/`](include/blcad/) — public headers (Core model and the optional Geometry layer)
- [`src/`](src/) — Core and optional Geometry implementation
- [`tests/`](tests/) — Catch2 tests
- [`examples/`](examples/) — `.blcad.json` / `.blcad.project.json` examples and headless flows
- [`docs/`](docs/) — architecture, implemented contracts, sequences, and roadmaps
