# BLCAD

BLCAD is a planned independent parametric CAD system for Linux. The project stores CAD model intent in BLCAD data structures and uses OCCT/Open CASCADE as the computed geometry kernel cache, not as the primary model.

Detailed architecture and feature status live in `docs/`. This README is intentionally kept short.

## Status

Current state: MVP-1 core skeleton, staged MVP-2 seeds for sketches, workplanes, profile geometry, recompute, STEP export, reference recovery, sketch diagnostics, and repair-command infrastructure, the MVP-3 parametric bolt circle, the MVP-4 seed for assembly parameters shared across parts, and a project container that owns one assembly plus embedded member parts.

There is no GUI yet.

For the full implementation sequence, see:

```text
docs/mvp-plan.md
```

## Technical basis

- C++20
- CMake + Ninja
- OCCT / Open CASCADE Technology
- nlohmann-json
- Catch2
- Qt 6 planned for the future GUI

## Build and test

Run core configure, build, and tests:

```bash
cmake --workflow --preset dev-build-test
```

Run geometry configure, build, and tests:

```bash
cmake --workflow --preset dev-geometry-build-test
```

Manual geometry build:

```bash
cmake --preset dev-geometry
cmake --build --preset dev-geometry
```

## Headless STEP export

```text
blcad_export_step <input.blcad.json> <output.step>
blcad_export_project <input.blcad.project.json> <assembly-parameter-id> <value> <output-dir>
```

Examples:

```bash
./build/dev-geometry/blcad_export_step examples/reference_plate.blcad.json build/reference_plate.step
./build/dev-geometry/blcad_export_step examples/bolt_circle_plate.blcad.json build/bolt_circle_plate.step
```

## Next technical step

The next technical step should add the first MVP-5 component instance seed.

1. Add a `ComponentInstance` record owned by `AssemblyDocument` or a closely related assembly-structure model.
2. Store stable instance id, display name, referenced project part document id, visibility, suppression state, and grounded/fixed state.
3. Add an initial rigid transform record for free placement, but do not solve constraints yet.
4. Validate that every component instance references an assembly member part and an owned project part.
5. Add JSON persistence for component instances inside the assembly/project structure.
6. Add project-level tests proving two instances can reference the same part document without duplicating part geometry.
7. Add a minimal headless inspection/export hook that lists component instances and their referenced part documents.
8. Keep mate/concentric/distance constraints, solver, DOF display, collision checks, subassemblies, and assembly-level STEP export deferred.

The completed project-container block is documented in `docs/project-container-mvp4.md`.
