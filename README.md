# BLCAD

BLCAD is a planned independent parametric CAD system for Linux. The project stores CAD model intent in BLCAD data structures and uses OCCT/Open CASCADE as computed geometry, not as the primary model.

Detailed architecture and feature status live in `docs/`. This README is intentionally short.

## Status

Current state: MVP-1 core skeleton, staged MVP-2 sketch/workplane/profile/recompute/reference blocks, the MVP-3 parametric bolt circle, the MVP-4 assembly/project container path, and MVP-5 assembly infrastructure through deterministic Mate/Distance/Concentric rigid-body solving and read-only local Jacobian-rank/remaining-DOF diagnostics.

The implemented assembly path now includes:

```text
component and constraint model intent
  -> deterministic active-constraint graph
  -> generated planar face and circular-cut axis target resolution
  -> explicit local-to-assembly rigid-transform evaluation
  -> planar Mate/Distance and axis-line Concentric residual construction
  -> one shared deterministic numeric residual/Jacobian system
  -> damped Gauss-Newton rigid-body solve on Project copies
  -> explicit atomic converged-result application
  -> read-only local Jacobian-rank and remaining-DOF diagnostics
```

Concentric uses the same shared numeric system, solver, result-applier, and rank analyzer as Mate/Distance. A regular one-free-body Concentric relationship is proven numerically as rank `4` over `6` rigid-body variables with `2` remaining local DOF.

There is no GUI yet.

For the complete implementation sequence, see `docs/mvp-plan.md`.

## Technical basis

## Next technical step

The next technical step is the first stable Insert constraint intent and a read-only composite Insert residual model.

That block should define semantic axial-seating geometry for the first supported circular feature family, add explicit persistent Insert relationship semantics, combine stable axis alignment with signed seating-plane separation in target A/B order, and prove a regular Insert relationship has local rank five with one remaining rotation-about-axis DOF before Insert is connected to the numeric solver.
